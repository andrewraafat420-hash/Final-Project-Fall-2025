Hardware Requirements
To run this code on the GPU, you strictly need:

NVIDIA Graphics Card: GTX 10-series, RTX 20/30/40-series, or newer. (AMD cards will not work with this specific script configuration).

VRAM: At least 4GB of Video Memory is recommended. If you have less, you might need to lower the BATCH_SIZE in the code.



advisable if have exactly 4 gigs or laptop version graphics card to reduce batch size

BATCH_SIZE = 32

Change it to:
BATCH_SIZE = 16

pip install tensorflow==2.10    
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy

 must be this version of tensorflow further updates for windows doesn't support this code or cuda cores at least for windows version




You need to download these from the NVIDIA website.

CUDA Toolkit: Version 11.2 (Recommended for TF 2.10)

cuDNN: Version 8.1 (Designed for CUDA 11.2)



# 1. Create a new environment (Python 3.9 is best for TF 2.10)
py -3.9 -m venv cuda_env

# 2. Activate it
cuda_env\Scripts\activate

# 3. Upgrade pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# 4. Install TensorFlow 2.10 (The last version to support Windows GPU Natively)
pip install tensorflow==2.10

# 5. Install Plotting library
pip install matplotlib






Follow the exact installation steps  (TensorFlow 2.10 + CUDA 11.2). Do not install "new" drivers or "new" Python, or it will break.
